To structure your FX spot movement prediction project effectively, you can follow these key steps:

---

### **1. Data Preparation**
**Actions:**
- Load and preprocess the data:
  - Clean up any missing or erroneous data points.
  - Ensure the data is time-synchronized and well-formatted.
- Normalize/Standardize features if necessary (e.g., prices, volumes).
- Engineer features:
  - **Lag Features:** Include previous price movements.
  - **Renko Features:** Extract from your Renko chart data.
  - **Technical Indicators:** Moving averages, RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands, etc.
  - **Statistical Features:** Rolling mean, standard deviation, skewness, etc.

---

### **2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
**Actions:**
- Visualize your data trends.
- Analyze the impact of technical indicators and features on price direction.
- Check correlations between features and target labels (up/down movement).
- Plot Renko charts to understand how they differ from traditional time-series data.

---

### **3. Label Creation**
**Actions:**
- Define your prediction target:
  - Use **binary labels** for up/down movements (e.g., 1 for up, 0 for down).
  - Determine a threshold for movement (e.g., >0.1% change = up, <-0.1% change = down).
- Align labels with the feature set considering lags.

---

### **4. Model Development**
**Steps:**
- Start simple and iterate to complexity.
- Consider these models:
  - **Logistic Regression:** As a baseline.
  - **Tree-Based Models:**
    - Random Forest
    - Gradient Boosting Machines (e.g., XGBoost, LightGBM)
  - **Neural Networks:**
    - Fully connected (MLP)
    - Recurrent (LSTM, GRU) for sequence modeling.
  - **Ensemble Models:** Combine multiple models for robustness.

**Implementation Tips:**
- Use **cross-validation** to split data into training and validation sets.
- Test multiple feature combinations and hyperparameters.

---

### **5. Backtesting Framework**
**Key Points:**
- **Split Data Chronologically:** Avoid data leakage by ensuring training data always precedes test data.
- Use rolling or expanding window validation for realistic backtesting.
- Record key metrics:
  - Accuracy, precision, recall for classification.
  - Confusion matrices for a detailed performance view.

**Performance Metrics to Evaluate:**
- Sharpe ratio if integrating with a portfolio.
- Profit and loss (PnL) curves for prediction strategies.
- Hit ratio (percentage of correct predictions).

---

### **6. Hyperparameter Tuning**
- Use grid search or Bayesian optimization (e.g., Optuna) for tuning.
- Focus on key parameters like learning rate, tree depth, and number of estimators for boosting algorithms.

---

### **7. Deployment & Iteration**
**Deployment Steps:**
- Create a real-time prediction system by integrating with live FX feeds.
- Monitor model performance periodically and retrain with recent data.
